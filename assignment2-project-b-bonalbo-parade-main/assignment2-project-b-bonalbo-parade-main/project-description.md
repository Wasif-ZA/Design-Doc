# Project A

## Introdcution
You have been approached by a client who has an idea for a system they want to develop that would facilitate and promote reusable coffee cups, without the user having to carry and clean their cup themselves. The company has developed bio-degradable RFID tags and has partnered with a company that produces high-quality reusable coffee cups. They developed a coffee cup with an embedded RFID tag that can be individually tracked using off-the-shelf RFID scanners. 

## The problem as they see it

The company has a mature product - a trackable reusable coffee cup - but would like to extend its business into using this technology to provide a coffee cup swap service to local and independent coffee shops. The idea is that people can "buy a cup", which is actually a subscription, which entitles them to the use of a coffee cup at any of the participating coffee shops, and drop it at any of the participating coffee shops.  Or at collection points that will be placed in strategically selected points, such as train stations, shopping centres, and libraries. There is no need to take the cup home or clean it. You can take your coffee, have it while you go shopping or travel by train, and leave it at another coffee shop or collection point.

For this product, they need a system that manages the distribution and collection of used cups from participating coffee shops. The coffeeshop themselves are subscribers. They get a certain number of cups that they can "sell" to people. The client then would ensure that new cups are delivered if needed, and excess cups deposited at a coffee shop are collected for cleaning and redistribution. The system should support managing each step of this process. It would be desirable if the same system could be used to manage the collection points.

The company has an agreement with a university to start a pilot project on its campus, and all coffee shops on campus signed on to the project. The client would hire a service team to oversee and manage daily operations. They would need an up-to-date overview of how many cups are where, such that they can pick them up, or restock when a coffee shop runs out of cups. 


## The idea

The idea is to implement a system that can track where cups are. It should provide the service team with up-to-date information. It should also allow coffee shop managers to subscribe to the service, update their subscriptions, and get a live update of their inventory of cups. It should include a loyalty program that rewards coffee shops that sell more reusable cups.

## Your responsibility

Your team is in contact with a group of stakeholders. Your task is to plan the software requirements for the new system â€“ which may or may not require the deployment of new hardware.

Note, this project is related to the other project. Be aware that you develop requirements for your project, and not for the other project, or both projects. That is why it is important to define the scope of a project early. And stick to it.
