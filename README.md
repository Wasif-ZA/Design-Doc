# Design Doc

## Project Overview

**Design Doc** is a project completed at **Macquarie University** where I worked on the **Implementation Planning** and **Initial Design** of a large software system. The focus was to create a clear and detailed **Software Design Document (SDD)** based on a set of requirements. The project was more about planning and design, just like in real-world software development when you need to figure out how things will work before you start building.

## What I Worked On

### 1. **System Architecture**
I designed a system that can grow over time without breaking things. It’s made up of three parts:
- **Presentation Layer**: This is what users interact with.
- **Business Logic Layer**: This handles all the rules and main processes.
- **Data Layer**: This takes care of storing and retrieving data securely and efficiently.

### 2. **Implementation Strategy**
I helped create a plan for how to build the project, from start to finish. This plan included:
- Milestones and timelines so we knew what to work on and when.
- Prioritizing tasks to stay focused on what matters most.
- A clear path that balances technical and business needs.

### 3. **Testing Plan**
To make sure everything works as expected, I came up with a testing plan:
- **Unit Testing**: To check that each small part of the system works.
- **Integration Testing**: To make sure the different parts work well together.
- **Performance Testing**: To see how the system performs under pressure.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: To make sure it meets the users' needs.

### 4. **Technology Stack**
We chose tools that made sense for the project:
- **Backend**: Django or Flask for handling the core logic and APIs.
- **Frontend**: React.js for a smooth and responsive interface.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for solid, reliable data management.

## Project Phases

1. **Design Phase**: Finalized the system’s structure and picked the right tools for the job.
2. **Development Phase**: Planned using agile sprints for incremental progress and feedback.
3. **Testing and Deployment**: Put the system through thorough testing and then deployed it.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Ambiguous Requirements**: When some parts of the requirements weren't clear, I made smart assumptions, documented them, and confirmed with the team.
- **Balancing Performance and Scalability**: We used caching to boost performance and made sure the system could scale as needed.

## Deliverables

1. **Software Design Document (SDD)**: Detailed architecture, diagrams, and the implementation plan.
2. **Test Plan**: A comprehensive testing strategy for functionality, integration, and performance.
3. **Project Presentation**: A short presentation covering the design, technology stack, and testing approach.

## Key Takeaways

- **Collaboration**: Worked closely with the team and stakeholders to keep everything aligned.
- **Architectural Planning**: Gained experience designing systems that can scale and evolve.
- **Testing Focus**: Made sure testing was planned early to catch any issues before development.

**Design Doc** shows my ability to lead the design phase of a project, create a solid system architecture, and plan for both functionality and scalability.
